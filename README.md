# Minesweeper
Recreated the classic Minesweeper game with added functionalities such as visibility toggling and four distinct layout generation options. Developed using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming principles, the project successfully incorporated recursion for essential game mechanics like cascading neighbors and revealing neighboring tiles. The game interface was implemented using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML), allowing interactive windows and buttons. A customized Makefile was designed to ensure the program runs consistently across different computers. The game includes original features like scoreboard, randomized mine placement, and flagging tiles, along with new features like a debugging button and two test buttons for initializing the game using preloaded board from files.
